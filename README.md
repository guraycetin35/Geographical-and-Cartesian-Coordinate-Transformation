# Coordinate Transformer ( X Y Z - φ λ H )
### This repo provides user with coordinate transformation between Geographical Coordinate System (Latitude, Longitude, and Height) and ECEF Coordinate System (XYZ).
3 different Ellipsoid options was added for the user; Hayford, Bessel and GRS80 .The user can choose either a location on the map to get its geographical coordinates or manually specify the coordinate of a point as xyz or φ λ H.
